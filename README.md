 1) Hash Map : 
 Implemented using open addressing with linear probing. Hash function used
  xn−1 +a(xn−2 +a(xn−3 +···+a(x2 +a(x1 +ax0))···)) with a = 41
  where xi specifies the i-th character of the string from the right.
 
 2) Weak AVL Tree : 
 Based on AVL trees with difference being use of rank for self balancing.
 
 3) Calcuator : 
 Implemented using the stacks.
 
 4) Stack : 
 Implemented with arrays doubling once filled. Amortized time complexity for insert is O(1).
 
 5) StackSort : 
 Since Implemnted using stacks can't sort any type of unsorted array. Sorting time complexity O(N^2)
